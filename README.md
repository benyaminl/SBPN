Simple Battery Power Now. A simple bash script that based on thinkpad X240 for showing the result as output, 
can be used with any DE that support generic monitor like XFCE applet. Currently only work on X240, 
but it already support for dual battery. 

## How to use
If  you on the XFCE, just use general monitor and add the file to the general monitor, and it will shown on the panel.

## Update
Any pull request are welcome :)
